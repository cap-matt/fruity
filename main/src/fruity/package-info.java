/**
 * Root package of the 'Fruity' application codeset.
 *
 * The purpose of this application is to meet the following requirements:
 * <b>Step 1: Shopping Cart</b>
 * <ul>
 *  <li>You are building a checkout system for a shop which only sells apples and oranges.</li>
 *  <li>Apples cost 60p and oranges cost 25p.</li>
 *  <li>Build a checkout system which takes a list of items scanned at the till and outputs the total cost</li>
 *  <li>For example: [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple ] => £2.05</li>
 *  <li>Make reasonable assumptions about the inputs to your solution; for example, many candidates take a list of strings as input</li>
 * </ul>
 * <b>Step 2: Simple Offers</b>
 * <ul>
 *  <li>The shop decides to introduce two new offers
 *   <ul>
 *    <li>buy one, get one free on Apples</li>
 *    <li>3 for the price of 2 on Oranges</li>
 *   </ul>
 *  </li>
 *  <li>Update your checkout functions accordingly</li>
 * </ul>
